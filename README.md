# Would You Rather?

Cohort Huckleberry Ruby Capstone Project

## Project Vision

This will be a small command-line program that asks the user to rank what (of two scenarios) they'd rather do.

Users will be able to add/edit/delete scenarios, as well as take a quiz to make choices between the scenarios.  After taking the quiz, the user can get a list of the things they'd rather do based on the results of their quiz.

## Features

### Viewing quiz results

In order to learn hard truths about my life priorities
I want to see what my priorities, as reflected by my quiz answer

### Taking the quiz

In order to learn hard truths about my life priorities
I want to take the quiz

### Adding a new scenario

In order to have illuminating connections in our quiz results
I want to add many scenarios

### Editing an existing scenario

In order to fix typos and/or clarify meaning
I want to edit an existing scenario

### Viewing all existing scenarios

In order to evaluate and/or manage the existing scenarios
I want to view all the existing scenarios

Usage Example:

  > ./would_you_rather manage
  1. Add a scenario
  2. List all scenarios
  3. Exit
  > 2
  1. eat a snake
  2. eat a steak
  3. butcher a cow

Acceptance Criteria:

  * All scenarios are printed out
  * Each scenario is given a number, which does not correspond to its database id

### Deleting a scenario
 
In order to remove duplicates and/or scenarios that aren't illuminating
I want to delete an existing scenario

Usage Example:

  > ./would_you_rather manage
  1. Add a scenario
  2. List all scenarios
  3. Exit
  > 2
  1. eat a snake
  2. eat a steak
  3. butcher a cow
  > 3
  butcher a cow
  Would you like to?
  1. Edit
  2. Delete
  3. Exit
  > 2
  "butcher a cow" has been deleted
  1. Add a scenario
  2. List all scenarios
  3. Exit

Acceptance Criteria:

  * Program prints out confirmation that the scenario was deleted
  * The deleted scenario is removed from the database
  * All references to the deleted scenario are removed from the database
  * After the deletion, the user is taken back to the main manage menu

### Importing baseline scenarios

In order to avoid having to come up with my own scenarios
I want to import an existing list of scenarios
